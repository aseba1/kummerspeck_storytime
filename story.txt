I landed in the plane and a sign behind me said 'Rammstein Flughafen'.
However smelt a delicious Gebaeck and walked towards the pastry shop.
I noticed a man, advertising an eating competition in front of the shop and being the wettbewerbsfaehig person I am, I approached him.
I was a little scared at first when I saw the big hund by his side.
But I saw that it was chained to the table next to him with a schloss. 
I bravely looked at his collar and saw "Eltz" on his collar.
So I gave the hund a big piece of Brot hoping they could break the chains.
Having secured the dog's trust I readied my trusty pocket Bratwurst in case his owner tried to stop me.
Just as the dog pulled on his chains, a loud noise erupted from the haupstrasse beside me.
I looked over and found a strange man exiting his car wearing a lederhosen. What a strange day indeed.
It got even stranger when the man took an apfelkuchen out from under his hat and took a large bite.
